## Final Project Overview

### Restaurant CMS system 
### *Spikes Seafood Market & Restaurant* 

---

This will primarily be a project to bring Spikes Seafood Market & Restaurant into
the 21st century. It's been around since 1926 and the web site they have looks like
it's about the same age, they need a modern face for their classic restaurant.

This will be built to be able to use with minimal modification in other small family
restaurants as well. This makes it valuable as a flexible, saleable product.
